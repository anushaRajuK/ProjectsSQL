# Data Cleaning and EDA using MySQL

**Dataset:** World Layoffs dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)

This SQL project focuses on analyzing global layoff trends by cleaning a comprehensive dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can help understand the economic impact of layoffs worldwide.

 # Data Cleaning

**Remove Duplicates:** Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure the dataset was free from redundant information, which could skew the analysis.

**Standardization:** Ensuring consistency in data formats, units, and values, which is crucial for accurate analysis.

**Handling Null and Blank Values:** Addresses missing data that could lead to inaccurate conclusions if left untreated.

**Removing Unnecessary Columns:** Simplifies the dataset by removing irrelevant or redundant columns, reducing noise in the analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

**General Data Overview:** Inspected the entire dataset to understand its structure and contents.

**Date Range Analysis:** Identified the datasetâ€™s time frame covering layoffs.

**Big Companies Going Under:** Found companies that laid off 100% of their employees, indicating they went completely under, and ranked them by the number of funds raised.

**Total Layoffs by Company:** Aggregated the total number of employees laid off by each company, highlighting those most affected.

**Industry-Wise Layoffs:** Summarized total layoffs across various industries to identify sectors with the highest impact.

**Country-Wise Layoffs:** Aggregated layoffs by country to observe the global distribution of job cuts.

**Yearly Layoff Totals:** Summed up layoffs by year, offering a view of how layoffs fluctuated annually.

**Layoffs by Company Stage:** Analyzed layoffs based on the stage of the companies (e.g., startup, growth, etc.) to see which stages were hit hardest.

**Rolling Total of Layoffs:** Calculated the cumulative total of layoffs month by month to track trends over time.

**Top Companies by Year:** Identified companies with the highest layoffs each year, showing which companies were most affected annually.

**Top 5 Companies by Year:** Ranked the top 5 companies with the highest layoffs for each year, providing a snapshot of the most significant layoffs.

_Thus Data cleaning ensured the dataset's accuracy and consistency, forming a solid foundation for analysis. The EDA revealed key trends in layoffs across industries, countries, and time periods, highlighting the most affected areas. These insights offer a clear understanding of layoff dynamics and inform data-driven decisions moving forward._
